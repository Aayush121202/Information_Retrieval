There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection,\\\" the statement added.CSL also said participants were told before the trial started that the vaccine could interfere with certain HIV diagnostic tests.Human trials have been conducted since July this year with 120 volunteers in Brisbane.The vaccine, manufactured at CSL''s biologics facility in Victoria, was developed using an existing UQ technology called a \\\"molecular clamp\\\", a patented system that is designed to stimulate an immune response and protect against people developing COVID-19.Reacting to the CSL news, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said abandoning the trial should show Australians the Government and researchers were proceeding carefully.\\\"What happened today is not a surprise to the Government. We are moving swiftly but not with any undue haste,'' he said, adding the system''s working as it should and Australians are protected, as always.The University of Queensland commenced a Phase 1 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate \\u2013 v451 in July 2020 to assess safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers.CSL was working towards taking responsibility for the Phase 2/3 clinical trial and large-scale manufacture of the vaccine, upon completion of successful trials.UQ Vice-Chancellor Deborah Terry said while the outcome was disappointing, she was immensely proud of the UQ team who had shouldered a heavy burden of responsibility while the world watched on.\\u201cI also want to thank our many partners, our donors \\u2013 including the Federal and Queensland Government \\u2013 and of course the 216 Queenslanders who so willingly volunteered for the Phase 1 trials,\\u201d Terry said.UQ vaccine co-lead Paul Young said that although it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, the team did not have the luxury of time needed.\\u201cDoing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone\\u2019s priority,\\u201d Young said.Australia has so far reported 28,011 cases of coronavirus and 908 deaths related to it, according to Johns Hopkins University.\",\n          \"In this photo released by Ministry of Defense of Armenia on Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020, an Armenian soldier fires an artillery piece during fighting with Azerbaijan's forces in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces accused each other of attacks on their territory Tuesday, as fighting over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh continued for a third straight day following the reigniting of a decades-old conflict.Armenia said one of its warplanes was shot down Tuesday by a fighter jet from Azerbaijan\\u2019s ally Turkey, killing the pilot, in fighting over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Both Turkey and Azerbaijan denied it.The move would represent a major escalation in the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region that was reignited on Sunday. It followed numerous calls from around the globe for a cease-fire.Armenian officials said an SU-25 from its air force was shot down in Armenian airspace by a Turkish F-16 fighter jet that took off from Azerbaijan, and the pilot was killed.The allegation of downing the jet was \\u201cabsolutely untrue,\\u201d said Fahrettin Altun, communications director for Turkey\\u2019s president. Azerbaijani officials called it \\u201canother fantasy of the Armenian military propaganda machine.\\u201dEarlier in the day, Azerbaijan\\u2019s Defense Ministry said Armenian forces shelled the Dashkesan region in Azerbaijan. Armenian officials said Azerbaijani forces opened fire on a military unit in the Armenian town of Vardenis, setting a bus on fire and killing one civilian.Armenia\\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied shelling the region and said the reports were laying the groundwork for Azerbaijan \\u201cexpanding the geography of hostilities, including the aggression against the Republic of Armenia.\\u201dDozens of people have been killed and wounded since fighting broke out Sunday. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry reported 84 servicemen killed, while Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev said 10 civilians were killed on its side, although he didn\\u2019t detail the country\\u2019s military casualties.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by the Armenian government since 1994 at the end of a separatist war following the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier.The region in the Caucasus Mountains of about 4,400 square kilometers (1,700 square miles), or about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware, is 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Armenian border. Soldiers backed by Armenia also occupy some Azerbaijani territory outside the region.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pushed for \\u201can immediate cease-fire and a return to the negotiating table\\u201d in phone calls with the leaders of both countries, her office said.She told them the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe offers an appropriate forum for talks and that the two countries\\u2019 neighbors \\u201cshould contribute to the peaceful solution,\\u201d said her spokesman, Steffen Seibert.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to Greece that \\u201cboth sides must stop the violence\\u201d and work \\u201cto return to substantive negotiations as quickly as possible.\\u201dTurkey supports Azerbaijan in the conflict, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urging Armenia to withdraw immediately from the separatist region.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey is \\u201cby Azerbaijan\\u2019s side on the field and at the (negotiating) table.\\u201dCavusoglu said the international community must defend Azerbaijan\\u2019s territorial integrity in the same way it defended the integrity of Ukraine and Georgia.\\u201cThey are holding Azerbaijan, whose territories have been occupied, on an equal footing with Armenia. This is a wrong and unjust approach,\\u201d Cavusoglu said after a visit to Azerbaijan\\u2019s Embassy in Ankara.Russia, which along with France and the United States co-chairs the Minsk group set up in 1992 to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, urged every country to help facilitate a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\\u201cWe call on all countries, especially our partners such as Turkey, to do everything to convince the opposing parties to cease fire and return to peacefully resolving the conflict by politico-diplomatic means,\\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.\",\n          \"Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif meets elder brother Nawaz in LondonPakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has met his elder brother and former premier Nawaz Sharif in London and briefed him on key political, economic and administrative issues facing the cash-strapped country.Shehbaz, accompanied by a group of senior leaders of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, travelled to London on a private trip on Wednesday.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the meeting reviewed in detail the steps taken by the government since it came to power last month and considered recommendations to save the public from inflation and power outages.The PML-N delegation dashed to London as political and economic pressure mounted on the government which is expecting organised protests by ousted premier Imran Khan who is demanding early elections.Next meeting on ThursdayMarriyum said another meeting has been scheduled for Thursday during which concrete decisions are expected to steer the country out of trouble, the Dawn newspaper reported.The meeting would approve a strategy to steer the country out of economic and constitutional crises. All decisions would be announced with the support of the coalition parties, she said in a statement.First in-person meeting since March 2020The UK visit marked the Sharif brothers\\u2019 first in-person meeting since March 2020. Other London-based party figures were also present at the meeting which was held at an undisclosed location, the report said.Shehbaz Sharif's10-member delegation included Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Power Minister Khurram Dastagir, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafiq.A video clip showed Nawaz Sharif, 72, patting his younger brother. A photo of the prime minister hugging his 70-year-old younger brother was also shared. Another photo showed the two Sharifs chairing the meeting.The bigger concern is the deteriorating economic situation and the inability to control the prices of daily items used by common citizens. Khan lashed out at the trip, saying at a public meeting on Tuesday that the entire cabinet was going to meet a \\\"corrupt and convicted\\\" person, that too on taxpayers\\u2019 money.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to stay in London for two to three days.Three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, against whom several corruption cases were launched by the government of Khan, had left for London in November 2019 after the Lahore High Court granted him four-week permission to go abroad for his heart treatment.Khan, 69, who was removed from office in early April through a Parliament vote, accused the US of conspiring to dislodge his government, citing communication from the country's ambassador in Washington. The US government has bluntly denied the allegations multiple times.PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif assumed the office of the prime minister on April 11. The term of the current House ends in August 2023.Nawaz Sharif and his casesNawaz Sharif was removed from power in 2017 after a decision by the Supreme Court against him. He was later convicted separately in two corruption cases in 2018.Sharif was given a 10-year prison sentence for owning property in London called the Avenfield case but was released two months later when the court suspended the sentences, pending a final judgement.But in December 2018 he was jailed for corruption again, this time for seven years, related to his family's ownership of steel mills in Saudi Arabia called the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case.In both cases, he failed to provide the money trail to procure these foreign assets.\\u00a0Sharif was in jail when allowed to go to London for four weeks for medical treatment but never came back.ALSO READ | Imran Khan claims \\u2018mafia\\u2019 Sharif family \\u2018paid a woman\\u2019 to write book to defame him in 2018\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9131,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 31630,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31631,\n        \"samples\": [\n          19774,\n          17859,\n          7220\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
